# Vitruv Applications for Component-Based Systems Archive

Vitruv is a framework for view-based software development. It assumes different models to be used for describing a software system,
which are automatically kept consistent by the framework and its applications. For general information on Vitruv, see our [Wiki](https://vitruv.tools).

This project contains applications for component-based systems that have been archived and are currently not maintained.
It contains the following transformations with according features and tests:
- Between PCM and Java Ddependency injection framework (based on Reactions language)
- Between PCM and Java EJBs (based on Reactions language)
- Between PCM and UML component model (based on Reactions language)
- Between UML component model and UML class model (based on Reactions language)
- Between PCM and Java classes (based on Mappings language)

It has been extracted from the [repository for component-based systems applications](https://github.com/vitruv-tools/Vitruv-Applications-ComponentBasedSystems).
Please note that it covers an outdated state such that artifacts may not be compatible with the current state of the dependencies and languages.
